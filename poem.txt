“Winds of a Distant Land”

In a land where the hills wear a crown of mist,
And the sea whispers tales that the sky can’t resist,
I wander through streets both foreign and old,
Where the echoes of history quietly unfold.

The cobblestones speak in a tongue of their own,
Of footsteps before me, of paths overgrown.
Yet here in this place, so far from my shore,
I find parts of me I hadn’t seen before.

The wind carries secrets from mountains so high,
The heather sways gently beneath the grey sky.
And though I am distant from the home that I knew,
I feel a new heartbeat, a rhythm, a hue.

For the stars here are different, yet somehow the same,
They shimmer with whispers and call out my name.
In the silence of twilight, in the hum of the rain,
I feel every distance dissolving its strain.

Oh, Scotland, with your wild and your lore,
You’ve opened your arms, you’ve opened the door.
And though my heart beats in two different lands,
It finds peace in your winds and rest in your sands.
